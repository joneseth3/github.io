                <h2> Moving Parts</h2>

                <p> 
                    During a bike fit there are a lot of moving parts, no pun intended. The fundamentals of a bike fit are that a person (the fitter) is examining the rider
                    pedal a bike and to try and see what is going with the riders biomechanics. For example, the rider's seat can be set to 77cm which might be too high for the rider
                    since their legs are not as long as other people who are 6'1 and so 77cm won't work for this specific rider. This scenario happens with other parts of a riders bike fit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lesson from the story is that the moving parts that a bike fitter will encounter during on session with a rider will change even if they work with a different rider of the same 
                    height. Biomechanically speaking, different parts of your body will affect your bike fit in different ways and they matter differently. Your leg length will decide how 
                    tall your seat post is set. Your arm and torso length will decide how far your handlebars are set. Your normal feet position when you are standing will decide your cleat position and 
                    even your crank length.  
                </p>

                <h2> Rider Tips for Fits </h2>

                <p>
                    If these topics sound interesting to you then head over to our "Bike Fit Information" tab which is where we go more in-depth on the biomechanics of bike fits. Despite all these moving parts
                    it is still possible that a rider can get a good bike fit from a in person bike fitter. There are some things that the rider can focus on improving when coming to a bike fit session that 
                    can help them get the best result. As the rider you can help yourself out by coming to a fit session with all the same things that you normal ride with. For example, come to the fit session 
                    with the same bibs, shoes, and gloves (or no gloves) that you ride with normally. Also come to the fit session with the same amount of flexibility as your normal would for any other ride. 
                    The best thing to do as the rider is just to come to a fit session with all the same kit and all the same preparedness as you would for any other ride. This way the way that the fitter sees you
                    is the same way you would look and feel with any other ride.

                <h2> Limitations of this Web App</h2>

                <p>
                    This web app is by no means a replacement to a in person bike fit experience, but it is a good starting point to get you thinking about your fit. There are some improvements that this web app could 
                    make. Firstly, it's not as good as in person! We can use all the algorithms to generate the best seat height for a person who has x length of legs but at the end of the day algorithms are based around 
                    generalizations which is not what you want when getting a bike fit. Secondly our web app is not the best for people who have a "special case" because of the same reason mentioned above. A "special case"
                    could be a tight lower back that a rider has, an injury they sustained during their college football years, or even if they have two different length legs. Everyone usually has a "special case"
                    so, it is always best to see a in person bike fitter. Lastly, we cannot move your bike parts for you! In person bike fitters will examine your fit and decided that it's best to move your head spacer
                    and so they will move it for you and let's say you need more spacers or a different sized stem, most bike fitters will have that extra piece on hand to swap out for you. Obviously we can't give you this
                    part through your computer screen, all though we wish we could!
