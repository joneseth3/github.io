                <li> The dynamic functionality I plan to implement is a form based data collection in which the data will

                </li>
                <li> I would also like to implemnt a interactive image of the type of bike the user would like to be fit on, 
                    where the user can click and drag different parts to see how that would change their fit.
                </li>
