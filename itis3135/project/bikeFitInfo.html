                <h2>Bike Fit Information</h2>
                <p id="header-p"> 
                    There are a lot of moving parts with a bike fit. It becomes even more complex when the rider has injuries where one muscle, joint, or tendon
                    might have to overcompensate for the injured part of the body. Below are tabs with information about each section of the body when it deals
                    with cycling. 
            </div>


            <div id="tabs">

				<h3> Legs </h3>
					<div id="tabs-1">
						<p>
                            The legs are arguably the most important part of the body when pedaling a bike. Besides the most obvious reasons, the legs are the most important part of  
                            a cyclist’s body because it is where two out of the three contact points are. The three contact points of a person’s body on a bike are your feet, your glutes,
                            and your hands. The legs obviously house the glute and your feet, so when you change something on your bike that is in the region of your legs you are affecting 
                            two-thirds of your contact points. 
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            The size/length of your legs is going to determine the height of your seat post, your seat choice, your seat position and tilt, your crank length, your q-factor, 
                            your cleat position, and size of your bike frame. All of these parts are essentially wait makes someone able to ride a bike fast and efficient. 
                        </p>
					</div>



				<h3> Torso </h3>
					<div id="tabs-2">
                        <p> 
                            Your torso is the "engine" of your machine when you are riding your bike. Since all your oxygen comes from your lungs, the expansion of your chest is 
                            vital to your ability to breathe properly and get the most out of your breathes. The length of your stem/reach, your handlebar width, your stem drop, and 
                            your seat position can all effect your torso.  
                        </p>
					</div>

				<h3> Arms </h3>

				    <div id="tabs-3">
                        <p> 
                            Your arms are not as essential to putting out power on the bike, but they are essential to ensure that you are comfortable and stable. Since you do not 
                            pedal a bike with your arms but instead just use your arms to keep you stable on the bike you could think of changing your arm placement as something 
                            that's superficial. Your arm length can go into deciding your stem length, your handlebar width, and your seat position.  
                        </p>
					</div>

                <h3> Shoulders/Neck/Back </h3>

					<div id="tabs-4">
                        <p>
                            All though your shoulders, neck, and back are a part of your torso they can still be affected differently, and they can still hurt because of different positions on the bike. 
                            The same scenario as the arms above, this area of the body does not have any direct correlation with power being put out on the bike but instead have a significant 
                            effect on how comfortable you feel. This aera can be affected by your stem length/reach, your stem drop, your handlebar size, and your handlebar width. 
                        </p> 
                    </div>
