        <h3>The terrible website I chose was: </h3>
        <h3>
            <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/"> Yale School of Art </a>
        </h3>
        <p>This website is the homepage for the Yale school of art ironically enough. The website seems to have multiple desgin flaws</p>
        <ul>
          <li> C: Contrast - The Yale School of Art seems to follow the contrast portions of CRAP desgin but to an extent that is
                far too much. There is no unity in color or theme.
          </li>
          <li> R: Repetition - The Yae Schoole of Art website does have some repetition in the form of using black and white photots and texte but
                besides that simple desgin their is no cohesive form of repetition.
          </li>
          <li> A: Alignment -  There is 0 cohesive alignment besides the use of left align. The website is only centering around the left side of
                  the page which makes for a very ugly site.
          </li>
          <li> P: Proximity - Proxmity on this site is the same as the alignment. Everything is too close to one another. Since the alignmnet is off
                the proxmity is off since evrything is so close together, there is no break to breath on the site. The
          </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>The "well done" website I chose was: </h3>
        <h3>
            <a href="https://www.svz.io/"> SVZ </a>
        </h3>
        <p>This website is the homepage for a website desgine company called "SVZ". Which is shown obviously because this website is just amazing.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> C: Contrast - The Website has a set color scheme that is based around a dark black but the colors used for images provid
                an amazing contrast to the whole site.
        </li>
        <li> R: Repetition - The repetition of the site can be found in their chosen theme for the project. Both the contunuity of the black
                and bright desgin images give you a warm welcome to the site.
        </li>
        <li> A: Alignment -  The alignment of the site is a left heavy alignment which I personaly think could be spread out a little more
                but with in the context of the site it works.
        </li>
        <li> P: Proximity - The proximity of all of the images and paragraphs is perfectly spaced out. I stil think that
                because of the alignment being heavy on the left side that the proximity could have done with using more of the space on the right side.
        </li>
        </ul>
